Our project is a lightweight chatbot application that leverages the power of ChatGPT Turbo 3.5 to provide intelligent responses to user queries. We've seamlessly integrated the ChatGPT Turbo 3.5 API key into our application, enabling users to interact with an AI-driven conversational agent.

On the frontend, we've utilized React and Vite to create a responsive and intuitive user interface. React allows us to build reusable components, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience. Vite, on the other hand, provides fast build times, enabling rapid development and iteration.

For the backend, we've employed Node.js to handle server-side logic and API requests. Node.js offers scalability and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for building robust backend systems. It enables us to process user requests, communicate with the ChatGPT Turbo 3.5 API, and deliver accurate responses in real-time.

Overall, our project combines cutting-edge technologies to deliver a user-friendly chatbot experience. By integrating ChatGPT Turbo 3.5 with React, Vite, and Node.js, we've created a powerful yet lightweight solution for conversational AI interactions.
